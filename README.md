#Welcome!
##Glad you found this Page.

As a former graphic and media designer I have gained experience in the non-code (CMS) area of websites and e-commerce platforms. Now I want to learn how to actively create websites and applications myself to see projects through from start to finish and be able to create my own projects.

I bring creativity and great commitment to all my projects and also enjoy creating content such as photography / videography and illustrations.
